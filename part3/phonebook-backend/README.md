###Notes:
Did exercises 3.10 and 3.11 at the same time

Exercise 3.21 is complete and the app works from the link above

Regarding exerces 3.22, I have solved all linting issues with the exception of the no-unused-vars error. I could solve this by turning this config off or by making the unused variables (result, response, request) do something completely useless but as there is no point I have decided to leave those errors in. All other linting errors are solved.
